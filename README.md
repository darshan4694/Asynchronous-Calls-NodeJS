## Asynchronous response handling using NodeJS Event-Driven, Non-blocking architectre
* Handled asynchronous responses by implementing custom callbacks
* App reads command line arguments, to manipulate command line instruction, I used yargs
* Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools, by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.

## Run app on local machine
* Download or clone the app
* Run app using node app.js
* follow command line instruction, to get weather information specific to a location
